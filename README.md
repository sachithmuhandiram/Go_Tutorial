## Go_Tutorial
This is a golang step by step description. I update this as I learn go lang, so there may be mistakes. If you see some, please update them.

I use [Todd McLeod's](https://twitter.com/Todd_McLeod) Udemy courses to learn go lang. Thank you very much for your awesome support.

## Folder structure

sample program and README file with descriptions.

## How to run
`go run main.go`

If there is a different method to run the code, it will be described in README in the folder.

#### Important Things to remember :

1. You can not keep unused variables. If you define a variable, you must use it in the program. Otherwise go compiler returns error.
2. Using IDE will help you to reduce development time.
